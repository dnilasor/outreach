# CD Foundation Stakeholder Personas

The following personas have influence over processes and decisions that the CD Foundation seeks to innovate and govern. These individuals participate in the community flywheel of open source software awareness, adoption, and advocacy. On some level, they all make decisions about using software to advance organizational goals. This makes them ideal target audiences for CDF content and programs.
