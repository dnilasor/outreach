# CD Foundation Stakeholder Personas

The following personas have influence over processes and decisions that the CD Foundation seeks to innovate and govern. These individuals participate in the community flywheel of open source software awareness, adoption, and advocacy. On some level, they all make decisions about using software to advance organizational goals. This makes them ideal target audiences for CDF content and programs. CD Foundation content and programs should identify a primary audience for each offering, and any secondary audiences.



## Application Developer

I develop web, mobile, and business applications for my organization. I am usually an individual contributor (IC) on a team. I use SDLC tooling as a means to an end and usually have some freedom to choose tools and environments. I may have strong opinions about enablers and constraints to my success as a developer, such as standard toolchains workflows at my organization, personal DevOps habits, and team behaviors. 

## DevOps Champion

I enable application teams to build software, and often build and maintain software and systems to enable them. I have firsthand knowledge of the way software is being developed and delivered at my organization. I must think about our SDLC from a macro perspective to make good decisions about tools and projects to invest team time and money in. Automation appeals to me because I often focus on scalability, repeatability, and productivity in my solutions.
